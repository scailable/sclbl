# upload is a wrapper for upload_onnx and upload_sklearn to provide backwards compatibility:
def upload(mod, features, docs={}, email=True, model_type="sklearn", _keep=False) -> bool:
    """upload uploads a trained AI/ML model to Scailable.

    The upload function is the main workhorse of the sclblpy package but effectively provides a
    wrapper to choose between the
     - upload_sklearn(mod, feature_vector, docs={}, email=True, _keep=False)
     - upload_onnx(path, docs={}, email=True)
    functions.

    The function checks the type, and if type = "sklearn" (default) calls the upload_sklearn() function.
    If type = "onnx" it calls the upload_onnx() function.

    Behavior:
    If type = "onnx"
        - The function first checks if the supplied path indeed references a .onnx file
        - Next, the docs are checked; if none are provided a warning is issued and a simple
        name is provided based on the model type.
        - Finally the onnx file and the supporting docs are uploaded to the toolchain.

    If type = "sklearn"
        - The function first checks whether the supplied model is ok (part of the list and fitted).
        - Next, it checks whether an example row is provided and if so it creates the example
        input and output .json objects.
        - Next, the docs are checked; if none are provided a warning is issued and a simple
        name is provided based on the model type.
        - Subsequently, we package the whole thing, including details of the user system, into a
        gzipped file that is stored on disc.
        - Finally the whole package is uploaded to the toolchain.

    Note: This method prints user-feedback by default. This feedback can be suppressed by calling the
        stop_print() method.

    Args:
        mod: The model to be uploaded (type="sklearn" OR the path to the stored ONNX file (type="onnx").
        features:
            - An example feature_vector for your model (type="sklearn" only).
            (i.e., the first row of your training data X obtained using row = X[0,:])
            - The input str (binary) to the onnx model (type="onnx" only). Can be an empty string.
        docs: A dict{} containing the fields 'name' and 'documentation'.
        email: Bool indicating whether a confirmation email of a successful conversion should be send. Default True.
        model_type: String indicating the type of model. Currently with options "sklearn" or "onnx". Default "sklearn"
        _keep: Bool indicating whether the .gzipped file should be retained (type="sklearn" only). Default False.

    Returns:
        False if upload failed, true otherwise

    Raises  (in debug mode):
        UploadModelError if unable to successfully bundle and upload the model.

def update_onnx(path, cfid, example="", docs={}, email=True) -> bool:
    """upload_onnx updates a fitted onnx model to Scailable.

    The update function is similar to the upload function in most respects (so, see its docs),
    but instead of creating a new endpoint it overwrites the docs and model of an already existing
    endpoint. Thus, there is an additional argument "cfid" providing the computeFunction Id
    of the endpoint that needs to be updated. Use sp.list_models() to get a list of your already
    existing endpoints.

    Note: If you solely want to change the documentation of an endpoint, you can either use the
        update_docs() function or the online admin interface at https://admin.sclble.net.

    Args:
        path: The path referencing the onnx model location (i.e., the .onnx file location).
        cfid: a string with a valid computeFunction ID.
        example: String example input for the onnx file.
        docs: A dict{} containing the fields 'name' and 'documentation'.
        email: Bool indicating whether a confirmation email of a successful conversion should be send. Default True.

    Returns:
        False if upload failed, true otherwise

    Raises  (in debug mode):
        UploadModelError if unable to successfully bundle and upload the model.
